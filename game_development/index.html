		<p> Breakout is a classic game, and in the process of recreating it in c++,
		I think I have experienced the closest I have ever felt to how I imagine a game jam developer feels.
		The process of generating this game didn't feel difficult.
		I have spent a great deal of time thinking about problems that I had to overcome for a project like this.
		It felt like a long jog or a marathon.
		The overall process felt like I always had one more thing to do and I knew what it was, I just had to do it.
		I was slowly constructing a tower from the ground up.
		That isn't to say there weren't a few snags.
		<br>
		<br>
		While implementing the audio I spent more than what I probably should have, trying to debug example code that was identical from multiple sources.
		But unlike most times when I am struggling to find a good example,
		I experienced something kind of novel this time around.
		For the first time in a while I solved the problem backwards.
		There was a problem with the sound repeating like a round,
		a round as in a song sung in a delay that overlaps itself.
		I spent a long time tweaking the examples,
		scratching my head,
		thinking that I must have done something wrong.
		They way I finally solved it was by taking a step back and thinking about why I might be having this specific problem.
		I saw that I was writing to a buffer in a callback function,
		and I had the thought that the only way it could be causing this caucophony,
		was if the buffer was never cleared.
		And ironically after few more minutes of testing the theory,
		it was solved.
		I often will go into a flow state when debugging tying things in a forward direction testing the cause of an issue by modifying my data or extrapolating some arbitrary values.
		While sometimes this immediately fixes my problem,
		it wasn't working in this case.
		This problem got me to think about solving it in the other direction.
		How could my code cause this specific error.
		When you only are manipulating buffers theres not a lot you can try in forward direction to see whats going on,
		you have to extrapolate and think from the other direction.
		Think about the underlying mechanics.
    <br>
		<br>
		If I had more time on this project I would likely attempt to implement more modern OpenGL elements into it.
		The way that OpenGL is tied into shaders and registers is a type of machine focused code that I and many other programmers have strayed away from.
		Most code nowadays is highly abstracted,
		and its always a good exercise to understand the actual mechanisms behind the higher lever code.
		It allows you to think in a much more analytical way about your code,
		like I mentioned in the first paragraph.
		Knowing all possible outcomes allows you to think in negative terms much like how some mathematical tautologies are proved by negation.
		Practicing to recognize problems about code in this way gives me more tools to struggle less and do more.
